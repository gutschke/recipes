    <p><em>This recipe makes laminated dough buns reminiscent of
       croissants, but with a crumb that takes inspiration from
       brioche dough. Baking in ring molds makes the buns pop up in
       the iconic shape of a mountain peak.</em></p>

    <p>Dissolve yeast in a table spoon of water and set aside.</p>

    <p>Combine flour, and water and heat in microwave for about 1
      minute, or until it reaches 150°F (65°C). Whisk tangzhong until
      smooth. Then let cool to room temperature.</p>

    <p>In a large bowl, combine water, sugar, egg, and condensed
       milk. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Then add tangzhong and
       stir until fully incorporated.</p>

    <p>Add buttermilk powder and both types of flour and mix until a
       dough forms. Empty bowl onto the countertop and knead for 10
       minutes. Desired dough temperature at this point is 77°F
       (25°C)</p>

    <p>Add the softened butter and proved yeast and knead until fully
       incorporated. The dough should be well-hydrated and feel a
       little sticky. Form a dough ball, transfer back to the bowl,
       cover, and let ferment until about doubled in size. This should
       take 90 to 120 minutes.</p>

    <p>Refrigerate for about 2 hours to bring the dough temperature
       down to about 40°F (5°C).</p>

    <p>In the meantime, transfer the remaining cold butter to a
       resealable plastic bag and roll it out to approximately a 9"
       square (25cm). This can also be done been sheets of parchment
       paper. If working in a hot climate, freeze butter while waiting
       for the dough to reach its target temperature; in temperate
       conditions refrigerate instead. The butter should be firm but
       pliable by the time you roll out the dough.</p>

    <p>Roll the dough to a 13" square (35cm). Turn the square of
       butter by 45° and place it into the center of the dough. Then
       fold over all four sides and pinch the seams closed.</p>

    <p>Roll the dough to a rectangle that is double in length:
       9" by 18" (25cm by 50cm). Fold letter-style in thirds, leaving
       you with a 6" by 9" rectangle (16cm by 25cm). Then refrigerate
       for 20 to 30 minutes. This was the first fold.</p>

    <p>Perform two more identical folds. After the third and last
       fold, refrigerate for 30 to 40 minutes, then roll out to a 14"
       by 8" rectangle (35cm by 20cm). Using a pizza roller, rectify
       the edges.</p>

    <p>Any discarded dough can be braided and formed
       into a "knot" that bakes free form. Make sure to tug the ends
       under the bun when doing this.</p>

    <p>Cut into six strips of 1&frac12;" by 14" (3.5cm by 35cm), roll
       tightly, and transfer to 3" (8cm) ring molds. Each disk should
       leave about &frac14;" (&frac12;cm) of space at the top of their
       mold.</p>

    <p>Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate over night. The dough
       will expand and should extend past the top of the mold.</p>

    <p>Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C) and bake the refrigerated buns
       for 30 minutes. After the first 10 minutes, reduce the
       temperature to 375°F (190°C)</p>

    <p>Let cool on wire-rack for about 5 minutes and then
       unmold. Serve warm.</p>
